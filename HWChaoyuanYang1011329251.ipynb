    "> - Consider dividing the code that ChatBot provides you into different jupyter notebook cells so that each cell concludes with a key printed result; the last line of code in a jupyter notebook cell will automatically print out in a formatted manner, so replacing something like `print(df.head())` with `df.head()` as the last line of a cell provides a sensible way to organize your code\n",

    "\n",
    "> This problem will guide you through exploring how to use a ChatBot to troubleshoot code using the \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mwaskom/seaborn-data/master/titanic.csv\" data set \n",
    "> \n",
    "> To initialially constrain the scope of the reponses from your ChatBot, start a new ChatBot session with the following slight variation on the initial prompting approach from \"2\" above\n",
    "> - \"I am going to do some initial simple summary analyses on the titanic data set I've downloaded (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mwaskom/seaborn-data/master/titanic.csv) which has some missing values, and I'd like to get your help understanding the code I'm using and the analysis it's performing\"\n",
    "        \n",
    "1. Use your ChatBot session to understand what `df.groupby(\"col1\")[\"col2\"].describe()` does and then demonstrate and explain this using a different example from the \"titanic\" data set other than what the ChatBot automatically provide for you\n",
    "    \n",
    "> If needed, you can help guide the ChatBot by showing it the code you've used to download the data **AND provide it with the names of the columns** using either a summary of the data with `df.describe()` or just `df.columns` as demonstrated [here](../CHATLOG/COP/00017_copilot_groupby.md)\n",
    "    \n",
    "2. Assuming you've not yet removed missing values in the manner of question \"7\" above, `df.describe()` would have different values in the `count` value for different data columns depending on the missingness present in the original data.  Why do these capture something fundamentally different from the values in the `count` that result from doing something like `df.groupby(\"col1\")[\"col2\"].describe()`?\n",
    "\n",
    "> Questions \"4\" and \"6\" above address how missing values are handled by `df.describe()` (which is reflected in the `count` output of this method); but, `count` in conjunction with `group_by` has another primary function that's more important than addressing missing values (although missing data could still play a role here).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Intentionally introduce the following errors into your code and report your opinion as to whether it's easier to (a) work in a ChatBot session to fix the errors, or (b) use google to search for and fix errors: first share the errors you get in the ChatBot session and see if you can work with ChatBot to troubleshoot and fix the coding errors, and then see if you think a google search for the error provides the necessary toubleshooting help more quickly than ChatGPT<br><br>\n",
